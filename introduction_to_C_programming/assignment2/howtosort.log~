There are many ways to sort data.  Here is a simple
sorting algorithm.

Lets say you have the following array of numbers:

8 11 13 3 9

Find the smallest among the numbers and exchange the first
element with the smallest.  After you have done this the
array will look like this:

3 11 13 8 9

Then among all the elements BUT the first, find the smallest
and exchange it with the second element.

3 8 13 11 9

etc. etc. etc.

Sort sequence:
8 11 13 3 9 -- lowest number in array is 3; swap with 8
3 11 13 8 9 -- ignoring first element, lowest number is 8; swap with 11
3 8 11 13 9 -- ignoring first and second element, lowest number is 9; swap with 11
3 8 11 13 9
3 8 9 13 11
3 8 9 11 13
