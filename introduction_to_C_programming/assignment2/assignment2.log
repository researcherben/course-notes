Read the file into an array of structures. We will
soon show how to use structures.  Then  repeatedly 
ask the user to sort the data. You can present the
 user with the following menu.

1) Name
2) City
3) Salary
4) Exit

The user chooses either 1, 2, 3, or 4.  If they choose
1 then sort and display the data in sorted order by name.
If they choose 2, then sort and display the data by city.  
If they choose 3, then sort and display the data by salary. 
If they choose 4, then print a list of their responses 
and exit the program.
